-- In this project, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to pull data regarding customers, products, and statistics.

#1 How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL
AND orderID <> ''						

#2 How many of those orders were iPhones?

SELECT COUNT(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL
AND orderID <> ''
AND product = "iPhone"				
  
#3 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#4 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
AND LENGTH(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#5 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1

#6 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity*price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#7 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(quantity), product, SUM(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in Feb. and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product
